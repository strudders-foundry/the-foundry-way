# How to organise and coordinate service standard assessments

## Pre-assessment process

### Identify the need for an assessment



### Discuss timelines and availability



### Book the assessment



### Organise a content and an accessibility review (for Beta and Live assessments)



### Recruit a panel (and observers)



### Get and distribute the briefing pack



### Organise the tech pre-call



### Organise a pre-call with assessors (and observers)



### Organise a comms channel with the panel



### Organise a post-assessment call / wash-up with the panel (and observers)

Service Standard Assessments team identifies dates of availability for assessments and sends the #calendar of booked assessments and remaining available assessment dates (link to be inserted) to departmental assurance teams weekly.

Available assessment dates will generally be Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday each week, and will avoid dates when assessor capacity is likely to be low (e.g cross gov community events or periods of high leave).


Departmental assurance teams identify services ready to come for assessment
and an appropriate date 6 weeks in advance, and complete the template with the service details for the date/dates they want. 

Assessment bookings will be allocated on a first come, first served basis. Generally only one assessment per day will be accommodated. 6 weeks’ notice must be given. Exceptions may be considered, depending on the ‘priority’ of the service, and availability of a panel (e.g. where there is a cancellation). Assessments dates should be booked only when it is certain that the team are ready for assessment - provisional bookings won’t be accepted and it should be noted that requests to reschedule at short notice will be unlikely to result in successful panel recruitment for the new date. 

Assessments team confirms assessment date/s directly with departmental assurance teams. 

N.B. Cancellations should be notified immediately, so that Assessments team can re-assign panel members to other assessments.

Departmental assurance team sends the assessment invitation to the service team and Assessments team shared in-box, along with the agenda and briefing template.

The briefing template should be returned 2-3 weeks before the assessment, for onward cascade to the panel and observers.

For beta and live assessments, for services with a start point on GOV.UK, the departmental assurance team arranges a content review

A Zendesk ticket should be sent to the GOV.UK Content Team. (DQ - if the assurance team don’t have a Zendesk account can they get one or could they raise a ticket via their content team?) This should be done as soon as the assessment is booked, to allow the Content Team time to plan this in to their work schedule. The Content Team will need access to the service and the briefing document, so these should be sent as early as possible. The Content Team will aim to send their report to the departmental assurance team 2 weeks’ in advance of the assessment date, so that it can be included in the briefing pack. 

For beta and live assessments, the departmental assurance team arranges an accessibility review.

DN - If this is agreed the process is to be determined - but the review should be completed no less than 2 weeks in advance of the assessment date, so that the report can be included in the briefing pack.

Assessments team recruits the panel and (trainee assessor) observers, and sends their contact details to departmental assurance teams so that they can include them in the invitation.

Cross government assessor panels will be sourced outside of the department the service sits in. The Lead Assessor will always be from outside of the service’s department. In exceptional circumstances, such as panel members dropping out at short notice and where replacements cannot be secured, if the requesting department has a replacement/s who is/are able to step in, and don’t have a conflict of interest, then these assessors may be considered. However, no more than two panel members will be allowed from the requesting department. Specialisms of trainee assessor observers should be included in the information sent to departmental assurance teams, so that they can be invited to the relevant pre-meets. Observer numbers should be kept to a maximum of 3. If departmental assurance teams would like to include other observers, this should be arranged / agreed with Assessments team in advance.

Departmental assurance team forwards the completed briefing template to the panel and observers, along with (a link to) the report template.

Before forwarding, the completed template should be checked to ensure that all information is included (including previous reports, etc.) and the link/s to the prototype/ service work/s. The briefing pack should be sent no less than 2 weeks before the assessment, to allow for leave etc. Ideally the report template will be accessible via Google Drive / Share Point etc, by all panel members, as collating the report separately is cumbersome and could lead to drafting errors and missed content or revisions.

Departmental assurance team arranges the pre-assessment technical call with the technical assessor, the technical lead from the team and appropriate observers.

This should be arranged for around 1-2 weeks before the assessment.

Departmental assurance team arranges the pre-assessment meet-up with the panel and observers.

This is an opportunity for the departmental assurance team to brief the panel, agree any tweaks or revisions to the agenda and highlight any issues with timings for the completion of the report etc. It should be conducted around 1-2 weeks before the assessment.

Departmental assurance team sets up an appropriate communication channel for the panel and observers.

This has historically been a cross-government Slack channel (set to ‘private’), but could be a MS Teams channel etc. It is invaluable in communicating before, during and following the assessment.

Departmental assurance team arranges a wash-up session with the panel and observers

This should be timed to be immediately following the assessment, or as soon afterwards as possible. It is an opportunity for the panel and observers to reflect and give first impressions/ agree outcomes point by point and / or over-all, and agree any additional next steps and the timing of the final report.

Departmental assurance team facilitates the pre-assessment call and the assessment

The Lead Assessor has responsibility for chairing the assessment, but the facilitator’s role is to ensure things run smoothly during the assessment, accommodate any logistical requests during the assessment and support the lead in time-keeping etc.

## During the process

### Facilitate the pre-assessment briefing call

During the pre-assessment briefing call with the panel, the Lead Assessor should do the following. The Coordinator should jump in and ensure this happens, if the Lead Assessor forgets (or doesn't know) to do so.

- Ensure that panel members know that they are writing their sections of the report, and how long they will have to do so
- Ensure everybody has access to [the agreed comms channel](#organise-a-comms-channel-with-the-panel)

### Facilitate the pre-assessment calls 


### Facilitate the assessment 

The Lead Assessor has responsibility for chairing the assessment, but the facilitator’s role is to ensure things run smoothly during the assessment, accommodate any logistical requests during the assessment and support the Lead Assessor in time-keeping, etc.

### At the end of (during) the assessment

Once the assessment has concluded, but before you finish the call, the Lead Assessor should do the following. The Coordinator should jump in and ensure this happens, if the Lead Assessor forgets (or doesn't know) to do so. 

- Explain to the Service Owner of the team being assessed when they should expect to receive the draft report (target 3 workings days)
- 

## Post Assessment Process

### The post-assessment call / wash-up

At the conclusion of the assessment, the Lead Assessor holds a [wash-up review session](#organise-a-post-assessment-call--wash-up-with-the-panel-and-observers) with the assessment panel. This should involve:

- an initial overview of the assessment (including initial thought on met/not met overall assessment)
- a summary of each point of the standard from each assessor (including indicative thoughts on met/not met assessment for each)
- reminding the panel when they are expected to have written their sections of the report
    - this should be sent to the Lead Assessor to bring together (style, consistency, etc.), who will [issue the report](#issue-report)

### Report Preparation

The report is a set of responses to the 14 sections of the Service Standard. 

Lead Assessor to coordinate any points of clarification required from the service team.
There is a nominal 3 day target to complete the report. 
The report must follow the [GOV.UK Style Guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide)

### Report Review

Lead Assessor checks report and panel agree on Met/Not Met for each element and overall Met/Not Met for service.

### Issue Report

Departmental assurance team distributes the report to the service team and the nominated recipients (email distribution list is appended to the report template). The team is given 5 working days to highlight any factual inaccuracies.

### Sub-domain process and GOV.UK Start page 

If the service has passed alpha assessment it  can now move into a private beta phase, subject to implementing the recommendations outlined in the report and getting approval from the GDS spend control team. The service must pass their beta assessment before launching their public beta.

To get the service ready to launch on GOV.UK the team needs to:

get a GOV.UK service domain name

work with the GOV.UK Content team on any changes required to GOV.UK content 


### Report Finalisation

The departmental assurance team lead and Lead Assessor agrees to any revisions on factual information reverted from the service team.

If Not Met the departmental assurance team lead agrees likely timescale for re-assessment, check availability of panel and agree nominated date. Reserve date in calendar for re-assessment with Assessments team, note if any panel recruitment required.

### Report Publication

Assessments team publishes report after 7 days unless outcome is rejected by service team

Send completed reports to the  dbd-assessment mailbox. The report will be reviewed for content, style and finalised before formal publishing on GOV.UK.

If an independent review of the assessment outcome is requested an arbitration process can be instigated. This will review the outcome and provide guidance on the report and if required any changes to the content - DN - process to be agreed
