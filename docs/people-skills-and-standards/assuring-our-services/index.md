# How we assure our products and services

In the Foundry, we follow the GOV.UK Service Manual '[governance principles for agile service delivery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/governance-principles-for-agile-service-delivery'. These principles are:

1. Don’t slow down delivery
1. Decisions when they’re needed, at the right level
1. Do it with the right people
1. Go see for yourself
1. Only do it if it adds value
1. Trust and verify

So what does this mean for us? Well, we apply these principles mostly to a few areas of our ways of working:

1. Security
1. Delivery quality and standards
1. Reporting and internal governance

## 1. Security

Security has [its own section](../../security/index.md) of the Foundry Way, so have a look. Generally speaking, we follow NCSC guidelines above all else, which promote a proportionate risk-based approach to security. 

## 2. Delivery quality and standards

As all product and services delivery teams and organisations across Government should, we ensure high quality delivery by following the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and, by definition therefore, the [Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) and the [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice). 

We know the Defence is a very particular environment to work in, with lots of cultural and other elements that make it different in places to elsewhere in Government. As such, we're putting together a [Defence Service Manual](https://standards.digital.mod.uk/), which helps teams across Defence to work in a GOV.UK Service Manual 'compliant' way. 

As with the rest of Government, we assess our services against the Service Standard with a formal assessment, at the end of most phases of delivery. To help teams and assessors alike, we have:

- [Guidance for teams](./service-standard-assessments/guidance-for-teams.md) being assessed
- [Guidance and resources for panel members](./service-standard-assessments/guidance-and-resources-for-assessors/index.md) carrying out the assessment

## 3. Reporting and internal governance

As with Security, [reporting has its own section](../../ways-of-working/index.md) of the Foundry Way.
